# 🎧 PipeWire Bit-Perfect Switcher

**A lightweight, automatic sample rate switcher for Audiophiles on Linux.**


**PipeWire Rate Switcher** detects the sample rate of your currently playing music (Spotify, Chrome, MPD, etc.) and automatically adjusts the PipeWire clock to match it. This prevents audio resampling, ensuring a **Bit-Perfect** audio path to your DAC.

## ✨ Features

* **Automatic Sample Rate Switching:** Instantly switches between 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz, 192kHz, and more based on the active stream.
* **Spotify & Browser Support:** Includes smart detection for apps that report non-standard rates (fixes the "Fractional Rate" issue in Spotify).
* **Strict Bit-Perfect Mode:** An optional "Audiophile Mode" that locks both the **Sample Rate** and **Quantum (Buffer Size)** for 1:1 hardware matching.
* **Real-Time Stats:** Displays the current Bit Depth (e.g., 32-bit Float) and Latency in milliseconds.
* **Flicker Protection:** Intelligent "Grace Period" logic prevents the clock from bouncing when tracks change.
* **System Tray Integration:** Runs silently in the background with a quick-access menu.

## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Install via .deb (Ubuntu / Debian / Mint)

Download the latest release from the **[Releases Page](https://www.google.com/search?q=../../releases)**.

Open a terminal and install it:

```bash
sudo apt install ./pw-rate-switcher_0.1_all.deb

```

*(Note: If you get a dependency error, run `sudo apt --fix-broken install` and try again.)*

### Option 2: Run from Source

If you prefer to run the Python script directly:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 pipewire-bin gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1

```


2. **Clone & Run:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pw-rate-switcher.git
cd pw-rate-switcher
chmod +x pw-rate-switcher.py
./pw-rate-switcher.py

```



## 🎛️ Usage Guide

### 1. Standard Auto-Switching (Default)

Just play music! The app will detect the stream and switch the rate.

* **Best for:** Daily usage, Spotify, YouTube, Background music.
* **Behavior:** Switches Sample Rate (Hz) only. Leaves Buffer Size (Quantum) to the system default for stability.

### 2. Strict Bit-Perfect Mode

Toggle the **"Strict Bit-Perfect Mode"** switch for critical listening.

* **Best for:** High-Res lossless files, Audiophile DACs.
* **Behavior:** Locks **Sample Rate (Hz)** AND **Quantum (Buffer Size)** to match the source file exactly.
* *Warning:* This forces the hardware to change buffers instantly. If your audio crackles or pops, disable this mode.

### 3. Manual Override

Click any of the Hz buttons (44.1kHz, 96kHz, etc.) to force the system to a specific rate. This disables automatic switching until you re-enable it.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why does it say "32-bit Float" when playing a 16-bit file?**
**A:** This is normal PipeWire behavior. PipeWire uses a 32-bit Floating Point container for all internal mixing to preserve quality and volume precision. Your DAC still receives the audio data perfectly intact (lossless).

**Q: The Latency number isn't moving. Is it broken?**
**A:** No, that is a good sign! Audio latency (buffer size) should be constant. If this number fluctuates wildly, it means your audio is unstable. A steady number (e.g., `21.3 ms`) means your connection is solid.

**Q: My screen flashes when the rate changes.**
**A:** Some DACs need a split second to change their internal clock. This is a hardware limitation, not a software bug.

## 🛠️ Building the Package

To build the `.deb` file yourself:

```bash
# 1. Create build structure
mkdir -p build/pw-rate-switcher/DEBIAN
mkdir -p build/pw-rate-switcher/usr/bin
mkdir -p build/pw-rate-switcher/usr/share/applications
mkdir -p build/pw-rate-switcher/usr/share/icons/hicolor/512x512/apps

# 2. Copy files
cp pw-rate-switcher.py build/pw-rate-switcher/usr/bin/pw-rate-switcher
cp pw-rate-switcher.png build/pw-rate-switcher/usr/share/icons/hicolor/512x512/apps/
chmod +x build/pw-rate-switcher/usr/bin/pw-rate-switcher

# 3. Build
dpkg-deb --build build/pw-rate-switcher pw-rate-switcher_0.1_all.deb

```
